Our C++ Daily Planner 
By Sam Reed, Edwin Guerra, Greg Blumer

	Our program focuses on creating a dialy planner that creates a linked list of the events that you are doing for that Day. You input an event such Homework, video games, or rest. The time that you will do that event such as a 1:00 p.m. And the priority of that event ranging from 1 to 10. 10 being not as urgent, 1 being the most urgent. The next option is to print all your plans. Then Afterwords you can Delete an event based on it's name, for example rest. The Option after that is to clear all plans that were stored. But if you decide not to delete everything you count the number of plans you have. The next option is to search an event by name, like if its called homework. The option after that is to search an event by tim, say the time is 1:00p.m. The next option is to search an event by priority level. Next you can sort events by time. The next option is to check if there is a schedule conflict so if you have two events at 1 it will tell you if there is a schedule conflict.Lastly you have the option to Quit the program.

	The only library you need is your basic iostream make sure you declare your header file and using namespace std. In order to run our program you need to have the main.cpp file, the planner.h headder file, and the planner.cpp file which contains the functions needed to operate. Please, please please, use codeblocks and the vm. Mac and windows could caouse problems sorry... 
Lastly I want to tank the TA's and Pla's for the help.
	As far as known bugs there are some bugs in the delete that we want you find i.e. they should be easy. and the boolean to check if there is a schedule conflict cannot tell the difference between p.m and a.m. Sorry...
